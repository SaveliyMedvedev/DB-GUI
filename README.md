# DB-GUI

This project is a graphical interface for obtaining information from a MySQL database. An alternative name for this project is "Theater Box Office". 


We studied SQL queries in my college (I'm in my second year of study) and prepared an assignment for the exam. I was bored, so I decided to make a simple interface for 3 requests.

## The task was something like this:

*Description of the subject area (Theater box office): Tickets for performances are sold at the theater box office. Ticket prices vary by row, theater and performance. Each day, no more than one performance can be performed in the theater. The performance is characterized by its title and author. Each buyer can buy as many tickets as he wants for any performances.
Tasks for the database: 
- What performances are on on a certain day?
- Are there tickets for a specific performance?
- How much does a specific ticket cost? *

This interface implements these three tasks through SQL queries to the database.

I apologize for the fact that everything in the interface is in Russian, because I showed it to the teacher

I welcome criticism and advice on implementation and design. I'm just getting started.
